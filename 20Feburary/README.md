# Imaginary Mechanism for Clock
For this week, inspired by in-class reading/exercise and presentations, I ideated imaginary mechanism for clock. 

### Sand Art Clock

Sand art clock is the clock mechanism that pours sand from one bucket to another at specific time, every quarter, half, and full hour, to eventually make a layered sand art. This project is inspired by the sand art that I saw at souq where, the sand artist pour in colored sand in layers to create a beautiful sand art in a bottle. 



### Inspiration

The visual inspiration for this project are these layered sand art that layers different colored sand and create a beautiful bottle.  

### How it works?
1) Every 15 minutes (15, 30, 45, 60) one sand bucket among the four sand buckets in the first row turn 180 degree and pour the sand to the 30 minute bucket in the second row for 30 seconds. The colors are poured in order for every quarter hour for example, yellow -> pink -> orange -> green in order. 
2) Every 30 minutes (30,60), the second row buckets move, that is the bottom cover tilts and opens the tiny hole for sand to rain to the big bucket in the forst row. This way, for 30 , 60 minutes, two mechanism can happen concurrently, where the pink sand is pouring from bucket 2 while bucket 4 is pouring sand out. 
3) 


### Extension & Questions
I am exploring options to make this mechanism run infinitely, rather than having to stop when the sand on the top layers run out. Like water fountain mechanic, if I can bring the layered sand back to the source sand bottles, It can run infinitely. However, there are some challenges such as:

1) Sand color can get mixed up and it won't be able to make distinguished
