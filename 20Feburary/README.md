# Imaginary Mechanism for Clock
For this week, inspired by in-class reading/exercise and presentations, I ideated imaginary mechanism for clock. 

### Sand Art Clock

Sand art clock is the clock mechanism that pours sand from one bucket to another at specific time, every quarter, half, and full hour, to eventually make a layered sand art. 

### Mechanics



### Inspiration

The visual inspiration for this project are these layered sand art that layers different colored sand and create a beautiful bottle. 

### Extension & Questions
I am exploring options to make this mechanism run infinitely, rather than having to stop when the sand on the top layers run out. Like water fountain mechanic, if I can bring the layered sand back to the source sand bottles, It can run infinitely. However, there are some challenges such as:

1) Sand color can get mixed up and it won't be able to make distinguished
